## Important Note: Test Buttons Hidden from UI

**All test buttons have been hidden from the end-user interface for a cleaner user experience. The backend functionality remains fully intact and accessible to developers.**

### Hidden Test Buttons:
- ~~"Test: Load PNG Flashcards from Backend"~~ - **HIDDEN** (Developer use only)
- ~~"Test: Load Quiz Files from Backend"~~ - **HIDDEN** (Developer use only)  
- ~~"Test: Load PowerPoint Files from Backend"~~ - **HIDDEN** (Developer use only)

### What This Means:
- ‚úÖ **End users** will see a clean interface without test buttons
- ‚úÖ **Backend functionality** still works automatically on page load
- ‚úÖ **Developers** can still trigger functions programmatically if needed
- ‚úÖ **Data loading** happens automatically via useEffect on component mount
- ‚úÖ **All features** (quiz files, PNG flashcards, PowerPoint files) still work normally

### For Developers:
If you need to manually trigger these functions for testing or debugging, you can:
1. Use browser console: `window.fetchQuizFiles()`, `window.fetchPngFlashcards()`, `window.fetchPowerPointFiles()`
2. Modify the component to temporarily show test buttons
3. Call the functions directly in the component code
