=== QUIZ GENERATION ANALYSIS ===
The course content provided outlines "Fundamentals of Artificial Intelligence: A Guided Exploration" over 6 modules, along with a separate, detailed 4-week Python programming primer. For this quiz, I will focus exclusively on the core AI concepts from the 6 AI modules (Module 1 through Module 6) as requested, aligning with the "Foundation & Analysis" theme. The Python content (Weeks 1-4) is treated as a separate foundational skill for implementation rather than core AI theory.

The analysis identifies key concepts suitable for quick recall, brief definitions, simple comparisons, and short analytical questions, adhering to the 1-2 sentence answer length and foundational difficulty. Examples include defining agent components, distinguishing search algorithm properties, explaining the role of heuristics, or outlining logic components. This ensures the quiz is completable within 10-15 minutes and effectively assesses foundational understanding and analytical thinking without requiring complex problem-solving or extensive writing.
