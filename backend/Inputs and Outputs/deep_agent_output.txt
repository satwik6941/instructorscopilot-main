# Week 1: Setting Up Your Python Environment - From Real-World Problem to Solution

## üîó Connecting from Previous Weeks
This is the first week of the course, so there's no prior knowledge to connect to. We're starting from scratch!

## üîç The Real-World Problem
Imagine you want to automate a repetitive task, like renaming hundreds of files or analyzing data from a website. Doing this manually would be incredibly time-consuming and error-prone. Many tasks in data science, web development, and even system administration require automation. Without a proper programming environment, these problems become exponentially harder to solve. Setting up your Python environment is the first step in tackling these real-world challenges.

## üí° Introducing the Topic as the Solution
This week, we will set up your Python environment. This involves installing Python, choosing a suitable code editor, and understanding how to run Python code. A correctly configured environment is crucial for writing, testing, and debugging Python programs efficiently, thus offering a solution to the problem of automating tasks.

## üìö Deep Explanation
Setting up your Python environment involves several key steps:

1.  **Installing Python:**
    *   Download the latest version of Python from the official Python website ([https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/)).
    *   Choose the appropriate installer for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).
    *   During installation, **make sure to check the box that says "Add Python to PATH"**. This allows you to run Python from the command line.
    *   For Windows, you can also use the Microsoft Store to install Python. However, the official installer is generally preferred.
    *   Verify the installation by opening a command prompt or terminal and typing `python --version` or `python3 --version`. This should display the installed Python version.

2.  **Choosing a Code Editor:**
    *   A code editor is a software application used to write and edit code. Popular options include:
        *   **Visual Studio Code (VS Code):** A free, powerful, and highly customizable editor with excellent Python support. It offers features like syntax highlighting, code completion, debugging, and Git integration.
        *   **PyCharm:** A dedicated Python IDE (Integrated Development Environment) with advanced features for professional development. It comes in both a free Community Edition and a paid Professional Edition.
        *   **Sublime Text:** A fast and lightweight editor with a wide range of plugins and customization options.
        *   **Atom:** A customizable editor developed by GitHub, offering similar features to VS Code.
        *   **Jupyter Notebook:** An interactive environment that allows you to combine code, text, and visualizations in a single document. It is particularly useful for data science and machine learning.
    *   VS Code and PyCharm are generally recommended for beginners due to their ease of use and extensive features.

3.  **Installing a Package Manager (pip):**
    *   Pip is the package installer for Python. It allows you to easily install and manage third-party libraries and packages.
    *   Pip is usually included with Python installations.
    *   Verify that pip is installed by opening a command prompt or terminal and typing `pip --version` or `pip3 --version`.
    *   If pip is not installed, you can download `get-pip.py` from [https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py](https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py) and run it using Python: `python get-pip.py`.

4.  **Creating a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended):**
    *   A virtual environment is an isolated environment for Python projects. It allows you to install packages without affecting the system-wide Python installation.
    *   To create a virtual environment, use the `venv` module:
        *   Open a command prompt or terminal.
        *   Navigate to your project directory.
        *   Type `python -m venv .venv` (or `python3 -m venv .venv`). This will create a directory named `.venv` containing the virtual environment.
    *   Activate the virtual environment:
        *   On Windows: `.\.venv\Scripts\activate`
        *   On macOS and Linux: `source .venv/bin/activate`
    *   When the virtual environment is active, your command prompt or terminal will be prefixed with the environment name (e.g., `(.venv)`).
    *   Install packages using pip while the virtual environment is active: `pip install <package_name>`.
    *   Deactivate the virtual environment when you are finished: `deactivate`.

## üåü Practical Examples

**Example 1: Installing Python and VS Code on Windows**

1.  Download the Python installer from [https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/). Choose the latest executable installer.
2.  Run the installer. Make sure to check the "Add Python to PATH" box.
3.  Download VS Code from [https://code.visualstudio.com/download](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) and install it.
4.  Open VS Code. Install the Python extension from the VS Code Marketplace.
5.  Create a new file named `hello.py`.
6.  Write the following code in `hello.py`:

```python
print("Hello, world!")
```

7.  Open a terminal in VS Code (View -> Terminal).
8.  Run the code by typing `python hello.py`. You should see "Hello, world!" printed in the terminal.

**Example 2: Creating and Using a Virtual Environment**

1.  Open a command prompt or terminal.
2.  Navigate to your project directory using the `cd` command.
3.  Create a virtual environment by typing `python -m venv .venv`.
4.  Activate the virtual environment:
    *   On Windows: `.\.venv\Scripts\activate`
    *   On macOS and Linux: `source .venv/bin/activate`
5.  Install the `requests` package: `pip install requests`
6.  Create a new file named `get_data.py`.
7.  Write the following code in `get_data.py`:

```python
import requests

response = requests.get("https://www.example.com")
print(response.status_code)
```

8.  Run the code by typing `python get_data.py`. You should see the status code `200` printed in the terminal, indicating that the request was successful.
9.  Deactivate the virtual environment: `deactivate`

## üìñ Additional Case Studies

Setting up a proper Python environment is crucial for data scientists. Imagine a data scientist working on a project that requires specific versions of libraries like NumPy and Pandas. Using virtual environments ensures that the project's dependencies are isolated and do not conflict with other projects or system-wide packages. This ensures reproducibility and avoids compatibility issues.

## üöÄ Looking Ahead
This week, you've learned how to set up your Python environment, including installing Python, choosing a code editor, and creating virtual environments. Next week, we'll dive into the basics of Python programming, covering data types, variables, and operators. This foundational knowledge is crucial for writing more complex programs.

# Week 2: Python Basics: Data Types and Operators - Building upon the Foundation

## üîó Connecting from Previous Weeks
Last week, we set up our Python environment, ensuring we have the tools to write and run Python code. This week, we will build upon that foundation by learning the fundamental building blocks of Python: data types and operators.

## üîç The Real-World Problem
Imagine you're building a program to manage inventory for a store. You need to store different kinds of information: the name of each product (text), the quantity in stock (numbers), and whether the product is on sale (true/false). Without understanding data types, you wouldn't be able to store and manipulate this information effectively. Also, you might want to calculate the discount price of a product. Without operators, performing such calculations would be impossible.

## üí° Introducing the Topic as the Solution
This week, we will cover Python's basic data types (integers, floats, strings, booleans, lists, tuples, dictionaries, sets) and operators (arithmetic, comparison, logical, assignment, bitwise, membership, identity). Understanding these concepts allows you to represent and manipulate data effectively, forming the basis for more complex programming tasks.

## üìö Deep Explanation

### Data Types

1.  **Integers (int):**
    *   Represent whole numbers without a decimal point (e.g., -3, 0, 42).
    *   Can be positive, negative, or zero.
    *   Example: `age = 30`

2.  **Floats (float):**
    *   Represent numbers with a decimal point (e.g., -3.14, 0.0, 2.718).
    *   Used for representing real numbers.
    *   Example: `price = 29.99`

3.  **Strings (str):**
    *   Represent sequences of characters (e.g., "hello", "Python", "123").
    *   Enclosed in single quotes (') or double quotes (").
    *   Example: `name = "Alice"`

4.  **Booleans (bool):**
    *   Represent truth values: `True` or `False`.
    *   Used for logical operations and conditional statements.
    *   Example: `is_active = True`

5.  **Lists (list):**
    *   Ordered, mutable (changeable) collections of items.
    *   Enclosed in square brackets ([]).
    *   Can contain items of different data types.
    *   Example: `numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`

6.  **Tuples (tuple):**
    *   Ordered, immutable (unchangeable) collections of items.
    *   Enclosed in parentheses (()).
    *   Similar to lists but cannot be modified after creation.
    *   Example: `coordinates = (10, 20)`

7.  **Dictionaries (dict):**
    *   Unordered collections of key-value pairs.
    *   Enclosed in curly braces ({}).
    *   Keys must be unique and immutable (e.g., strings, numbers, tuples).
    *   Values can be of any data type.
    *   Example: `person = {"name": "Bob", "age": 25}`

8.  **Sets (set):**
    *   Unordered collections of unique items.
    *   Enclosed in curly braces ({}).
    *   Used for mathematical set operations like union, intersection, and difference.
    *   Example: `unique_numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}`

### Operators

1.  **Arithmetic Operators:**
    *   `+` (Addition): Adds two operands.
    *   `-` (Subtraction): Subtracts the second operand from the first.
    *   `*` (Multiplication): Multiplies two operands.
    *   `/` (Division): Divides the first operand by the second.
    *   `//` (Floor Division): Divides the first operand by the second, returning the integer part of the quotient.
    *   `%` (Modulo): Returns the remainder of the division.
    *   `**` (Exponentiation): Raises the first operand to the power of the second.

2.  **Comparison Operators:**
    *   `==` (Equal to): Returns `True` if the operands are equal.
    *   `!=` (Not equal to): Returns `True` if the operands are not equal.
    *   `>` (Greater than): Returns `True` if the first operand is greater than the second.
    *   `<` (Less than): Returns `True` if the first operand is less than the second.
    *   `>=` (Greater than or equal to): Returns `True` if the first operand is greater than or equal to the second.
    *   `<=` (Less than or equal to): Returns `True` if the first operand is less than or equal to the second.

3.  **Logical Operators:**
    *   `and`: Returns `True` if both operands are `True`.
    *   `or`: Returns `True` if at least one operand is `True`.
    *   `not`: Returns `True` if the operand is `False`.

4.  **Assignment Operators:**
    *   `=` (Assignment): Assigns the value of the right operand to the left operand.
    *   `+=` (Add and assign): Adds the right operand to the left operand and assigns the result to the left operand.
    *   `-=` (Subtract and assign): Subtracts the right operand from the left operand and assigns the result to the left operand.

    *   `is not`: Returns `True` if both operands do not refer to the same object.

## üåü Practical Examples

**Example 1: Calculating the Area of a Rectangle**

```python
length = 10  # Integer
width = 5.5  # Float
area = length * width  # Multiplication operator
print(area)  # Output: 55.0
```

**Example 2: Checking if a Number is Even**

number = 7
is_even = number % 2 == 0  # Modulo and comparison operators
print(is_even)  # Output: False
```

**Example 3: Storing Student Information in a Dictionary**

```python
student = {
    "name": "Charlie",  # String
    "age": 20,  # Integer
    "is_enrolled": True  # Boolean
}
print(student["name"])  # Output: Charlie
```

**Example 4: Using Lists and Membership Operators**

```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "orange"]
if "apple" in fruits:  # Membership operator
    print("Apple is in the list")  # Output: Apple is in the list
```

## üìñ Additional Case Studies

Consider a scenario where you need to process user input from a website. The input might be in the form of strings, and you need to convert them to integers or floats for calculations. Understanding data types and operators allows you to validate the input, perform necessary conversions, and handle potential errors.

## üöÄ Looking Ahead
This week, you've learned about Python's basic data types and operators. Next week, we'll explore control flow statements (loops and conditionals), which allow you to create programs that make decisions and repeat actions based on certain conditions.

=== PROCESSING WEEK 3 ===

# Week 3: Control Flow: Loops and Conditionals - Making Decisions and Repeating Actions

## üîó Connecting from Previous Weeks
In the previous weeks, we set up our Python environment and learned about data types and operators. Now, we'll use this knowledge to control the flow of our programs, allowing them to make decisions and repeat actions.

## üîç The Real-World Problem
Imagine you are writing a program to process a list of student grades. You need to check if each grade is passing or failing (decision-making) and calculate the average grade (repetition). Without control flow statements like loops and conditionals, this would be a tedious and inefficient process.

## üí° Introducing the Topic as the Solution
This week, we'll explore control flow statements, including `if`, `elif`, `else` (conditionals) and `for` and `while` loops. These statements allow you to create programs that can make decisions based on conditions and repeat blocks of code multiple times.

## üìö Deep Explanation

### Conditional Statements (`if`, `elif`, `else`)

Conditional statements allow you to execute different blocks of code based on whether a condition is true or false.

1.  **`if` statement:**
    *   Executes a block of code if a condition is true.
    *   Syntax:

```python
if condition:
    # Code to execute if the condition is true
```

2.  **`elif` statement (optional):**
    *   Specifies an additional condition to check if the previous `if` condition is false.
    *   You can have multiple `elif` statements.
    *   Syntax:

```python
elif condition:
    # Code to execute if the condition is true
```

3.  **`else` statement (optional):**
    *   Executes a block of code if none of the preceding `if` or `elif` conditions are true.
    *   Syntax:

```python
else:
    # Code to execute if all conditions are false
```

Example:

```python
age = 20
if age >= 18:
    print("You are an adult")
elif age >= 13:
    print("You are a teenager")
else:
    print("You are a child")
```

### Loops (`for`, `while`)

Loops allow you to repeat a block of code multiple times.

1.  **`for` loop:**
    *   Iterates over a sequence (e.g., a list, tuple, string, or range).
    *   Syntax:

```python
for item in sequence:
    # Code to execute for each item in the sequence
```

Example:

```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "orange"]
for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit)
```

2.  **`while` loop:**
    *   Repeats a block of code as long as a condition is true.
    *   Syntax:

```python
while condition:
    # Code to execute while the condition is true
```

Example:

```python
count = 0
while count < 5:
    print(count)
    count += 1
```

### Loop Control Statements

1.  **`break` statement:**
    *   Terminates the loop prematurely.
    *   Used to exit a loop based on a specific condition.

2.  **`continue` statement:**
    *   Skips the rest of the current iteration and continues with the next iteration.
    *   Used to bypass certain parts of the loop based on a specific condition.

Example:

```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
for number in numbers:
    if number == 3:
        continue  # Skip number 3
    print(number)
    if number == 4:
        break  # Exit the loop when number is 4
```

## üåü Practical Examples

**Example 1: Determining if a Number is Positive, Negative, or Zero**

```python
number = -5
if number > 0:
    print("Positive")
elif number < 0:
    print("Negative")
else:
    print("Zero")
```

**Example 2: Calculating the Sum of Numbers in a List**

```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
sum = 0
for number in numbers:
    sum += number
print("Sum:", sum)
```

**Example 3: Printing Even Numbers Using a `while` Loop**

```python
number = 2
while number <= 10:
    print(number)
    number += 2
```

**Example 4: Searching for an Item in a List**

```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "orange"]
search_item = "banana"
found = False
for fruit in fruits:
    if fruit == search_item:
        found = True
        break
if found:
    print(search_item + " found in the list")
else:
    print(search_item + " not found in the list")
```

## üìñ Additional Case Studies

Consider a program that simulates a simple ATM. The program needs to check the user's PIN (conditional statement) and allow the user to perform multiple transactions (loop). Control flow statements are essential for creating such interactive and functional programs.

## üöÄ Looking Ahead
This week, you've learned about control flow statements, including conditionals and loops. Next week, we'll explore functions and modules, which allow you to organize your code into reusable blocks and extend the functionality of Python with external libraries.

# Week 4: Functions and Modules - Organizing and Reusing Code

## üîó Connecting from Previous Weeks
In the previous weeks, we learned about data types, operators, and control flow statements. Now, we'll learn how to organize our code into reusable blocks using functions and extend Python's functionality with modules.

## üîç The Real-World Problem
Imagine you are building a complex application that requires performing the same calculations or operations multiple times. Writing the same code repeatedly would be inefficient and make the code harder to maintain. Functions allow you to encapsulate these operations into reusable blocks, making your code more organized and easier to understand. Furthermore, many tasks require functionalities that are not built into Python directly. Modules allow you to import and use external libraries that provide these functionalities.

## üí° Introducing the Topic as the Solution
This week, we'll explore functions (defining, calling, parameters, return values, scope) and modules (importing, using standard modules, creating custom modules). These concepts enable you to write more modular, maintainable, and scalable code.

## üìö Deep Explanation

### Functions

Functions are reusable blocks of code that perform a specific task.

1.  **Defining a Function:**
    *   Use the `def` keyword to define a function.
    *   Specify the function name, parameters (optional), and a colon.
    *   The function body is indented.
    *   Syntax:

```python
def function_name(parameter1, parameter2):
    # Function body
    # ...
    return value  # Optional return statement
```

2.  **Calling a Function:**
    *   Use the function name followed by parentheses.
    *   Pass arguments (values) for the parameters (if any).
    *   Syntax:

```python
result = function_name(argument1, argument2)
```

3.  **Parameters and Arguments:**
    *   Parameters are variables defined in the function definition.
    *   Arguments are the actual values passed to the function when it is called.
    *   Types of parameters:
        *   **Positional arguments:** Passed in the order they are defined.
        *   **Keyword arguments:** Passed with the parameter name (e.g., `name="Alice"`).
        *   **Default arguments:** Parameters with default values (e.g., `age=25`).
        *   **Variable-length arguments:** `*args` (for positional) and `**kwargs` (for keyword).

4.  **Return Values:**
    *   A function can return a value using the `return` statement.
    *   If no `return` statement is present, the function returns `None`.

5.  **Scope:**
    *   The scope of a variable determines where it can be accessed.
    *   Types of scope:
        *   **Local scope:** Variables defined inside a function are only accessible within that function.
        *   **Global scope:** Variables defined outside any function are accessible from anywhere in the code.

Example:

```python
def greet(name, greeting="Hello"):
    """Greets the person passed in as a parameter."""
    return greeting + ", " + name + "!"

message = greet("Bob")  # Uses default greeting
print(message)  # Output: Hello, Bob!

message = greet("Alice", "Good morning")  # Uses custom greeting
print(message)  # Output: Good morning, Alice!
```

### Modules

Modules are files containing Python code that can be imported and used in other programs.

1.  **Importing Modules:**
    *   Use the `import` statement to import a module.
    *   Syntax:

```python
import module_name
```

2.  **Using Standard Modules:**
    *   Python has a rich set of standard modules (e.g., `math`, `random`, `datetime`).
    *   Access functions and variables within a module using the dot notation (e.g., `math.sqrt(16)`).

3.  **Creating Custom Modules:**
    *   Create a new Python file (e.g., `my_module.py`).
    *   Define functions and variables in the file.
    *   Import the module in another program using the `import` statement.

4.  **`from ... import` statement:**
    *   Imports specific functions or variables from a module.
    *   Syntax:

```python
from module_name import function_name, variable_name
```

Example:

```python
import math

square_root = math.sqrt(25)
print(square_root)  # Output: 5.0

import random

random_number = random.randint(1, 10)
print(random_number)  # Output: A random number between 1 and 10
```

## üåü Practical Examples

**Example 1: Calculating the Area of a Circle Using a Function and the `math` Module**

```python
import math

def calculate_circle_area(radius):
    """Calculates the area of a circle given its radius."""
    return math.pi * radius ** 2

radius = 5
area = calculate_circle_area(radius)
print("Area:", area)
```

**Example 2: Generating Random Passwords Using a Function and the `random` Module**

```python
import random
import string

def generate_password(length=8):
    """Generates a random password of a specified length."""
    characters = string.ascii_letters + string.digits + string.punctuation
    password = ''.join(random.choice(characters) for i in range(length))
    return password

password = generate_password()
print("Password:", password)
```

**Example 3: Creating a Custom Module for Utility Functions**

Create a file named `utils.py` with the following content:

```python
def add(x, y):
    """Adds two numbers."""
    return x + y

def subtract(x, y):
    """Subtracts two numbers."""
    return x - y
```

In another program:

```python
import utils

result = utils.add(5, 3)
print("Sum:", result)  # Output: Sum: 8

result = utils.subtract(10, 4)
print("Difference:", result)  # Output: Difference: 6
```

## üìñ Additional Case Studies

Consider a data analysis project where you need to perform various statistical calculations. You can create functions for each calculation (e.g., mean, median, standard deviation) and organize them into a custom module. This makes your code more modular and reusable across different projects.

## üöÄ Looking Ahead
Congratulations! You've completed the introductory Python course. This week, you learned about functions and modules, which are essential for writing organized and reusable code. You can now build more complex and sophisticated programs by combining the knowledge and skills you've gained throughout this course.
