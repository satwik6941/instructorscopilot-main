# 📘 AI Copilot for Instructors – Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## 🧭 Project Overview

**Goal**: Build an AI Copilot platform that helps instructors generate personalized, structured, and up-to-date course content with minimal input.

**Scope**: A working MVP that can:
- Generate an entire course/module from a topic and difficulty level
- Personalize the content for students using pre-uploaded profiles
- Scan for outdated lessons and suggest updates using curated sources

---

## 👤 Target Users

- Educators, instructors, and curriculum designers
- Researchers designing learning programs
- AI education program managers

## ✅ MVP Feature Set

### 1. 📚 Course Generation Engine (Module 1)
- Inputs: Topic + difficulty level (e.g., "LangChain", "Intermediate")
- Output: Course structured by weeks, each with:
  - Overview (macro → micro structure)
  - Learning outcomes
  - Sub-lessons with explanations
  - Visuals (e.g., diagrams, concept maps)
  - Application-based examples
  - Quizzes/checkpoints

### 2. 🧑‍🎓 Personalization Engine (Module 2)
- Input: `student_profiles.csv`
- Adapts content for:
  - Learning styles (Visual / Reading-Writing / Kinesthetic)
  - Interests (e.g., music, robotics, design)
  - Experience level
- Example: Visual learners receive extra diagrams; beginners get more scaffolded explanations

### 3. 🔄 Content Freshness Scanner (Module 3)
- Uses static mappings (topic → sources) from `freshness.md`
- Highlights outdated sections by comparing with recent content snippets
- Option to regenerate affected lessons

## 🎯 Success Metrics (MVP)

| Metric | Target |
|--------|--------|
| Time-to-module generation | ≤ 10 minutes |
| % of content flagged & updated (freshness) | ≥ 30% with flagged updates |
| Personalization match feedback (simulated) | ≥ 80% satisfied (manual validation) |

## 🧱 Input/Output Structure

**Required Instructor Input**
- Topic (string)
- Difficulty Level (enum: beginner/intermediate/advanced)

**Optional Inputs**
- Duration (default: 5 days)
- Learning outcomes (fallbacks enabled)

**Student Input**
- CSV file with:
  - Name
  - Learning Style
  - Interests
  - Experience Level
  - Quiz Score (optional)

---

## 📦 Assumptions

- RAG will be used in a pre-indexed/local vector DB fashion
- Agentic workflows will be modular, sequential, and stateless
- Instructor inputs are minimal; defaults will fill in the rest

---

## 🚫 Out of Scope for MVP

- Audio/video content generation
- Live web scraping
- Agent memory & autonomous loops
- LMS integration or analytics dashboards

---

## 🛣 Future Expansion

- Full user dashboard with course tracking
- Peer review workflows
- Audio/video micro-lectures
- Multi-agent orchestration and adaptive personalization
